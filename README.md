# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
The project is a real-world simulation of Airbnb booking platform. It involves a deep dive into **full-stack development**, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. The goal is to build a **scalable backend system** while mastering complex architetures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics. The **Tech Stack**  that will be used includes **Django** framework for Backend Development, **PostgreSQL** for database, **GraphQL** for API Query Language, **Docker** for containerization and **Github Actions** for CI/CD.

## Project Goals 
* Master collaborative team workflows using **GitHub**.
* Deepen their understanding of **backend architecture** and **database design** principles.
* Implement advanced **security** measures for **API development**.
* Gain proficiency in designing and managing **CI/CD pipelines** for efficient deployment.
* Strengthen the ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.

## Team Roles
| Role | Key Responsibility in the Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Developer** | Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic. |
| **Database Administrator** | Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services. |
| **QA Engineer** | Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards. |

## Technology Stack
| Technology | Purpose in the Project | 
| :--- | :--- |
| **Django** | **Backend Framework:** Python framework used to build the core application logic, handle requests, and manage server-side operations for the booking platform. |
| **PostgreSQL** | **Database System:**  Open-source relational database management system chosen for storage. |
| **GraphQL** | **API Query Language:** Used to create an efficient and powerful API. It allows the client to request *exactly* the data it needs, reducing overhead and improving application speed. |
| **Docker** | **Containerization:** Ensures the application and all its dependecies run consistently across all environments (development, testing, CI/CD, production). |
| **Github Actions** | **CI/CD Platform:** Used to set up the automated **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines** for automated testing, quality checks, and deployment. |
